Welcome to Monopoly! 
Here's how to play: 

1) Find 2-8 players to play with you
2) Choose one of these players to be the Banker. The Banker is in charge of all the money, property, houses, and hotels that belong to the Bank. This player monitors the money and directs purchases. 
3) Set up the Monopoly Board. Unfold the board on a flat surface and space out the players so that each has enough room for their individual properties and money. Also lay out the Chance and Community Chest cards on the board in the spaces marked.
